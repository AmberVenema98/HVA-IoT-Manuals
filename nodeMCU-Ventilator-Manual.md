# Smart Breeze

## Introduction
The goal is to simulate a functional smart ventilator using a combination of a weather API, a Telegram bot and and a control button to turn the ventilator on and off. The system will allow users to manually adjust the ventilator settings through the bot's interface, while also offering an automated mode that adjusts the ventilator based on the weather API.
