# Node MCU Show Me Love

## Introduction
The goal is to have your nodes communicate in pairs. Node 1 sends something to node 2 and it responds by sending it to an output (LED strip, vibrating motor, etc.).

### What do you need?
* 2x NodeMCU Arduino Board, ESP8266
* Arduino IDE
* LED strip
* 2x Micro USB cable
* WIFI connection
* Key Switch Sensor

A new window will now appear. Enter a name for your Feed and write a brief description. Iâ€™ll name mine "Kussiekussielove." Then, click "Create" to finalize the Feed.
