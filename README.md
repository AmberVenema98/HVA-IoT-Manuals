## :heart::electric_plug: Two NodeMCUs Communicating with Each Other
In this project, you'll be making two NodeMCUs communicate with each other. The idea is simple: Node 1 sends a message to Node 2, and Node 2 responds by activating an output, such as turning on a light or triggering a device

## :wind_face::globe_with_meridians: Smart Fan Simulation with Weather API and IFTTT Notifications
This guide explains how to create a simulation of a smart fan that automatically turns on based on the current weather. The NodeMCU will get temperature data from a weather API, and when the temperature reaches a certain level, the fan will turn on. Additionally, you'll receive a notification on your phone through IFTTT when this happens.
